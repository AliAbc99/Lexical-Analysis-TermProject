# Lexical-Analysis-TermProject

Project number 1 and Project number 2 are different projects in the context of Lexixal Analysis.

For running the Projects I provided a Makefile in each folder

You need to write make in the terminal, the required files will be created.
To test the project you to write the following command in terminal:
./project input_Example.txt > output.txt


In the first project, input_Example.txt is a C code. It will be converted into a Python code and be saved in the output.txt file. If there is any error, it will be shown in the output file.
